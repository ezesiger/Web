    <h1>Poor Images and Circulation</h1>
    <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/10/61362/in-defense-of-the-poor-image"> Hito Steyerl - In defense of the poor image</a>

   <p>Poor images are low resolution copies of images.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Digital images that get degraded and compressed the more they are shared.</li>
        <li>They hold layers of compression, reproduction, resynthesis</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Carries history of uploads, downloads, shares, screenshots and reediting</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

<p>Poor images involve the users’ participation in its distribution but also its creation, editing and co-authoring. Poor images lose quality so they can gain speed and be shared quickly.</p>

<p><i>“The condition of the images speaks not only of countless transfers and reformattings, but also of the countless people who cared enough about them to convert them over and over again, to add subtitles, reedit, or upload them.”</i></p>
