    <h1>What is a meme?</h1>
    <p>Originally: referred to ideas or behaviors that spread culturally through person to person imitation</p>
    <p>Now: refers to internet memes, often formulaic and easy to make and edit. Memes typically feature absurdist text on or above a low-res image</p>
    
    <p>They are still shared from person to person and are often remixed and reinterpreted en-masse leading to templates or trends. The way they travel from person to person highlights how information spreads on the internet. Through social media, downloads, direct message, and forums</p>
