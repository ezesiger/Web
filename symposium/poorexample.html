    <h1>Poor Images and Circulation</h1>
    <p>There are entire communities of people dedicated to collecting poor images like: r/MoldyMemes, r/countablepixels</p>
    <img src="img/poorimage2.webp" width="45%">
    <img src="img/poorimage3.webp" width="45%">
    <br>
    <p>Many of these images have been shared and compressed so many times that their text is completely illegible, distorting the original message</p>
    <p>What happens when these poor images are pushed to the extreme?</p>
