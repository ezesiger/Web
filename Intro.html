            <h2> &nbsp; </h2>

                This website is about surveillance. Since I was 14 years old I have been using google keep as
                my notes app. For 7 years I have been writing everything from passwords to lists to dreams to 
                diary entries in Google Keep. This website contains 40 of those notes. <br><br>
                
                I wanted to explore the idea of surveillance in this project. What does it mean that Google has all 
                this information about me. The most intimate details of my life are stored somewhere in the Google 
                cloud server. Is it being used to train AI, can corporations and governments access this information 
                illegally? Google has faced 
                <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/google-accused-constant-surveillance-deceptive-methods-maintain-access-user-data-1672183">lawsuit</a> after 
                <a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-smartphone-surveillance-verdict-damages-c93e0150089fd47ec396f1d0abacb4a8">lawsuit</a> over privacy 
                violations.<br><br>

                I wanted to put you in the position of the surveiller. What can you find out about me from reading 
                through this selection of notes? If these are the notes I included what were in the ones that I left 
                out? <br><br>

                Do you feel comfortable in the position of the voyeur? It shouldnâ€™t be normalized because this level of 
                access is not normal. This is a tiny selection of information about me. Google has infinitely more about me, 
                they have even more about all of you. And that's just one company. How much does Apple know about you? What about Facebook?<br><br>

                Please be careful when dragging the notes :)
