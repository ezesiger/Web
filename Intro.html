                This website is about surveillance. Since I was 14 years old I have been using Google Keep as
                my notes app. For 7 years I have been writing everything from passwords, to lists, to dreams, to 
                diary entries in Google Keep. This website contains 40 of those notes. <br><br>
                
                I wanted to explore the idea of surveillance in this project. What does it mean that Google has all 
                this information about me. The most intimate details of 
                my life are stored somewhere in the Google cloud server. Is it being used to train AI or sell me ads? 
                Can corporations and governments access this information without my knowledge? Google has faced 
                <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/google-accused-constant-surveillance-deceptive-methods-maintain-access-user-data-1672183">lawsuit</a> after 
                <a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-smartphone-surveillance-verdict-damages-c93e0150089fd47ec396f1d0abacb4a8">lawsuit</a> over privacy 
                violations.<br><br>

                I wanted to put you in the position of the surveiller. What can you find out about me from reading 
                through this selection of notes? If these are the notes I included what were in the ones that I left 
                out? <br><br>

                Do you feel comfortable in the position of the voyeur? It shouldn’t be normalized because this level of 
                access is not normal. This is a tiny selection of information. Google has infinitely more about me, 
                they have even more about all of you. And that's just one company.<br><br>

                Please be gentle when dragging the notes :) if they stop working just refresh the page<br><br>
