            <h2> &nbsp; </h2>
            <p>then I'm waking around in this distorted version of the primary campus near the 
                climbing frame and field<br><br>

                something in an airport. travelling to go on a school trip with multiple stops.
                i have so many suitcases bc my roommate left the last location early and left some 
                stuff. so I'm walking to the airport with all of these bags I'm trying to put them 
                onto a card and they won't open they keep falling off of it and I also have like four
                backpacks that have to carry on my back so I'm at the back of the group and most people 
                have already like gone through security and stuff and I'm trying to get through security 
                but then there's just one security guard who's being really rude. and then he starts 
                making fun of me and he's like oh there's bitch is so fucking slow like all this this girl 
                so slow she's got a pink fucking bag pack it up girly and. and I get really pissed off and 
                I like start pointing at him and yelling at him and calling him sexist like you're fucking sexist. <br><br>

                old bis Library mixed with primary canteen. class watching some video on 
                projector but it keeps buffering and i have to go to the head of security to get 
                him to unlock and then lock the security system so the video can load.<br><br>

                then this white blonde bully guy escapes school in a car and is chased by cobie 
                smulders (who is a teacher)(i think she mightve started as Ms Davies) timothee 
                chalamet (student) and another hot lady teacher who is a celebrity but i can't 
                remember who. in this car chase timothee flips into the back of his car and is 
                chilling w him as a distraction and then cobie fires a tranquilizer dart at the bully 
                and he falls asleep at the wheel. then there's an implied gay love triangle 
                between cobie the other teacher and someone else and they talk about love 
                notes and apparently cobie is an English teacher<br><br>

                then the dream becomes minecraft and theyr talking Abt stuff<br>
                apparently the bully is is an alien and Timothy is really rich and apparently aliens 
                put all the wealth on earth. and the bully asked Timothy what's it like like taking all 
                their money and riches and Timothy it's really mad and he acts like a spoiled little 
                brat and he's like oh I hate it and you like kicks the floor and apparently he really 
                hates being rich.<br><br>

                and then the dream changes and of some kind of a hero adventurer in my thirties 
                guy and he has a girlfriend or something. the only part of the dream that I can 
                remember is when he and his girlfriend go through a cornfield and sit at the top 
                of the hill and then around like sunset his grandma comes to the cornfield and 
                challenges him it's like a door or something and then pulls out like a keychain 
                with a tiny sword on it and he like picks out the tiny sword and a tiny spear and he 
                tells her that he doesn't want to fight. and then she's like the girlfriend offers to 
                fight in the Grandma's place and then the grandma reveals and she's just like 
                haha JK it was actually like a dance battle.<br><br>

                and then the dream changes and I'm in New York and we're going to watch this 
                really abstract Broadway performance and we think it's rent but then I'll join the 
                theater we realize that it's actually called Sophia and it's this abstract like black 
                box performance piece and we're in the theater with Maya and chi ngoc. 
                basically the show starts and it's pretty normal Broadway stuff they sing a little 
                opening number and then they pause the show and they're like let's welcome 
                some special guests today and they put the spotlight on like some random bitch I 
                like this girl she's very special and they put a spotlight on me and I'm like what 
                this is super fucking weird .. and then they put a spotlight on Maya and 
                she physically like runs or walks out of this spotlight. anyways in front of me 
                is Annie and she's like resting her back on my legs and then right as the next 
                number is about to start she asked me if I want to let go to the other side of the 
                theater so I sit on her back and she gives me a piggyback ride and runs across 
                the theater and then she like drops me down right next to Bernie Sanders who's also
                watching this. and I like don't want to make things weird so I decide I'm going to 
                like go up to Bernie after the show and tell him what a big fan I am. I'm also there
                is like so many people in school (Kim, nha trang, Khanh Linh, Annie, jenny, Jamie 
                <b><s>Xxxxxxxx</s></b>, Hannah <b><s>Xxx</s></b> and more) here's where the performance are to get weird and it 
                becomes less of a Broadway thing and more of like a modern art thing it's a giant 
                scream like playing videos and it's kind of like something because having on screen 
                and there's a bunch of the timeline rushing past at the bottom and it's like a bunch 
                of pictures like YouTubers. and the performance continues and there's a bunch of parts 
                like every minute video on the screen is changing and telling a story and at some point 
                I'm not really paying that much attention I'm talking to the people next to me and like 
                we're being kind of annoying and the people around us are like they seem kind of irritated
                getting out of my seats and moving around and like everyone's like going.. and the seats are 
                kind of organizing metal bleachers so people like changing their roles and like going 
                underneath and like standing up and like just leaning into bleachers the future is getting 
                kind of crazy and at one point the video shows like a tiktok dance tutorial then everyone starts 
                doing the dance. and then after the dance Paul Rudd comes in and tells everyone to sit back 
                down. and then after I'm sitting down I'm like talking to Annie and Jamie <b><s>Xxxxxxxx</s></b> because 
                Annie looks at me and says like oh my God you dyed your hair back to Brown. 
                and I'm really confused I'm like no I didn't and then I look at my hair and it's brown 
                and I'm just so confused. and I'm like I didn't know bleach could wash out I thought it 
                like burned my hair permanently so it would always be like light underneath. well guess 
                not. also in the dream Kim show me a video of her and Khanh Linh and nha trang walking around 
                like the streets of New York and nha trang had pigtails and her hair is like it's not blonde 
                but it's a really light brown like dark dirty blonde and it looks really good but it's not 
                like her entire hair is like that it's just like maybe three quarters or maybe like 7/8 <br><br>

                also throughout the dream it keeps cutting to timelapse footage of sped up Minecraft building
